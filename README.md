# Analysis-of-Cardiovascular-Diseases
##  Python Project
<br>
This project focuses on the analysis of a cardiovascular disease (CVD) dataset, which includes information about general health, physical measurements (e.g., BMI, height, weight), health conditions (heart disease, diabetes, arthritis), and lifestyle factors (diet, alcohol consumption, smoking history).

The aim of the project is to uncover patterns and correlations between health conditions and lifestyle choices, and provide visualizations to better understand the relationship between different variables.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of 308,854 records and 19 columns, including:

- General health status
- History of checkups, exercise, and smoking
- Presence of specific diseases (heart disease, diabetes, etc.)
- Demographics (age, gender)
- Lifestyle factors (diet, alcohol consumption)
- Physical measurements (BMI, height, weight)

### Libraries Used
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

### Analysis Outline
The notebook provides the following analyses:

- General Health Distribution: A bar chart displaying the distribution of general health status.
- Correlation of Health Conditions: A heatmap of correlations between various health conditions (e.g., heart disease, diabetes).
- Age and Heart Disease Analysis: A visualization of heart disease prevalence across different age categories.
- BMI and Health: Boxplots showing BMI distributions across heart disease and diabetes status.
- Lifestyle Factors and Heart Disease: Boxplots analyzing the relationship between lifestyle factors (e.g., alcohol, diet) and heart disease.
